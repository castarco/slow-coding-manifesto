# The Slow Coding Manifesto

The software development industry is prone to create and publicize manifestos
of diverse nature. Somehow, we all came to realize that ours is a young field
that needs us to push its boundaries, not only from the scientific and technical
perspective, but also its practical and human sides.

Because of that, we've seen published documents like the
[GNU Manifesto](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.en.html), with clear doses of
activism; or
[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and
[The Async Manifesto](http://asyncmanifesto.org/), focusing on organizational
and communication aspects; or even relatively long essays like
[The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/),
or
[Homesteading the Noosphere](http://catb.org/~esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/),
offering a more insightful and philosophical perspective.

This manifesto is a little bit different, it has some bits of activism, although
not focusing on what to do or how to do things, but on why. As the world goes
on, some of us want to have a meaningful and positive impact on it: we want to
contribute with our knowledge and skills to solve our current and future
problems in a socially and environmentally responsible way.

## What do we want

1. We code to have fun, because we enjoy solving problems, and because we care
   about others; not because we want to compete or to have a ball pool in our
   office (which we might want anyway, though).
2. We spend a big chunk of our time programming, mostly for work, and we want to
   enjoy it, not to be stressed because "that's what work is supposed to be".
3. We refuse to fit in the workaholic stereotype, there's life beyond our
   computers' screens and keyboards.

## Why do we do what we do ♪ ♫ ♬

4. We automate stuff not to accelerate production & economy, but because we want
   to liberate people from tedious, boring and/or dangerous work, because we
   want to help avoiding errors & disasters due to human error.
5. We optimize software and processes not to make them run faster, but to save
   hardware resources and energy.
6. Programming is a social activity, it benefits from respectful relations
   between coworkers. Caring about code quality is not just perfectionism, but
   caring about our colleagues, who will have to deal with our code.

Be kind to yourself, take your time, make beautiful code... and enjoy.
