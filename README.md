# The Slow Coding Manifesto

TODO: missing introduction

1. We code to have fun, because we enjoy solving problems, and because we care
   about others; not because we want to compete or to have a ball pool in our
   office (which we might want anyway, though).
2. For many of us, coding is not just a job, but a form of life, and as such, we
   want to enjoy it, not to be stressed because "that's what work is supposed to
   be".
3. We refuse the fit in the workaholic stereotype, there's life beyond our
   computers' screens and keyboards.
4. We automate stuff not to accelerate production & economy, but because we want
   to liberate people from tedious, boring and/or dangerous work, because we
   want to help avoiding errors & disasters due to human error.
5. We optimize software and processes not to make them run faster, but to save
   hardware resources and energy.
6. Programming is a social activity, it benefits from respectful relations
   between coworkers. Caring about code quality is not just perfectionism, but
   caring about our colleagues, who will have to deal with our code.
